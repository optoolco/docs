### Running Operator Toolbox

If you don't have any AWS credentials on your computer, you will see a screen
asking for them.

You can copy your credentials from [here][1].

If you do have credentials on your computer, the list of applications on the left
hand side of the screen will be expanded, apps are ready to download, launch and update.

Click on the side-bar headings to expand them, the apps section contains all the apps
that you currently have installed or can install with your license.

If you've never launched an app before, it will download. If you have, it will just launch.
Updates are downloaded in the background.
