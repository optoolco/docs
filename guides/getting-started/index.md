the Toolbox provides updates and other features including...

- Wizards (Guides that help you get things done).
- Notifications about tasks (ie, builds, or permission requests).
- Global settings that apply to all Opeartor apps.


### After downloading

When you open the Toolbox app you will be greeted with a app launcher screen.
Click the other headings on the left to see more wizards or settings.
