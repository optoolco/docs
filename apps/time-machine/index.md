# Time Machine

The _Time Machine_ app is a GUI for managing change.

## Viewing changes

All changes that are made by Operator apps, by either you or your team members,
can be reverted or exported. Changes can be reviewed by scrolling the table. It

Is also possible to refine the changes that you are seeing by sorting and or
filtering. Expand the `Filter` section of the property panel on the right side
of the screen for more options.

## Sync

Time Machine can automatically create and or use a repositoy for your changes
and sync them for you. Alternatively, you can sync only with your peers.
