# Toolbox

## What is the toolbox app?

You can launch Operator apps the same way as any regular app on your OS. But
the Toolbox provides updates and other useful features...

- Wizards (Guides that help you get things done).
- Notifications about tasks (ie, builds, or permission requests).
- Global settings that apply to all Opeartor apps.
