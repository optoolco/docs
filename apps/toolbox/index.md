# Toolbox

## What is the Opeartor Toolbox?

When you start Operator, an icon will appear in your `tray`, near your
Wifi icon (the top or lower bar of your desktop, depending on what OS you
are using).

If you have a team license, this app is how your team members can find and
connect to you.

You can launch Operator apps the same way as any regular app. But Toolbox
provides a lot of useful features...

### Wizards

Wizards guide you through common tasks. They make your job easier by reducing
the steps to only what is needed. Some wizards for example...

- Creating or updating static websites
- Configuting and managing domains
- Managing users and their permissions

Wizards are also extensible, see [this][0] section for more details.

### Notifications

Toolbox is a single place to get real-time notifications about what your team is
working on and what they need. You can get alerts in realtime when...

- A team member needs permissions to do something.
- A long running task has completed on your computer or the computer of someone on your team (ie, builds or CI jobs)

### Updates

Operator tries to not be annoying about updates. You never have to update if you
don't want. Especially when you are busy, we wont harass you about updating your
software. If you launch your app from Toolbox, you'll always be using the most up
to date versions.

### Settings

Settings that apply to all Opeartor apps.
